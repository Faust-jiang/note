pytrees are nested collections of tuples, lists or dicts, you can think of them as generalized tuples in JAX which contain arrays or scalars or functions.-- 
--those are called leaves.  Equinox represents neural network models as pytree
jax.vmap
numpyro is a probablistic programming library 
np.stack(list of arrays or in brackets like (a,b,c), axis=)       #join a sequence along a new axis

today's task: comprehend the function siganture, tensorlayernorm, dropout 
signature and dropout understood, nn.Layernorm still unclear

"`LayerNorm(shape)(x)` must satisfy the invariant `shape == x.shape`"
    136         f"Received `shape={self.shape} and `x.shape={x.shape}`. You might need "
    137         "to replace `layer_norm(x)` with `jax.vmap(layer_norm)(x)`.\n"
    138         "\n"
    139         "If this is a new error for you, it might be because this became "
    140         "stricter in Equinox v0.11.0. Previously all that was required is that "
    141         "`x.shape` ended with `shape`. However, this turned out to be a "
    142         "frequent source of bugs, so we made the check stricter!"
